CUDA disease propagation simulation
===================================

This is a disease propagation simulation which uses CUDA 5.0 to access the graphics card GPU. OpenGL, FreeGlut and Glew are used to generate a 3D display.

Green nodes are healthy, red nodes are infected and blue nodes are recovered (and immune to reinfection). Using the GPU we can simulate a great many more nodes than we can with a CPU.
